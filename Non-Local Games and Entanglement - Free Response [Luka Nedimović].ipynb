    "Take for the example Bell State = $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle).$ <br/> It seems like whatever is the measured value of the first qubit, it's also the value of the second qubit. When trying to generate the magic square, we have seen that it's not really possible, but we don't even need to generate full magic square - we just need one column and one row. Alice and Bob could use that entangled pair to perform certain operation on their qubits that could lead to perfect outcome. <br/>\n",
    "Also, if they share more qubits probably they can somehow tell each other what is the their input, if necessary. They could figure value of each other's input after the measurement (if we assume that the measurement is not necessarily in the end of the circuit).\n"
